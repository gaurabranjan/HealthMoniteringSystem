# HealthMoniteringSystem
To create a health monitoring system using NodeMCU and Blynk server, you'll need to follow these steps:

1.Install the necessary libraries:

	=>Install the Blynk library by going to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries in the Arduino IDE and searching for "Blynk" to install it.

2.Set up Blynk:

	=>Create a new Blynk project on the Blynk app (available for iOS and Android) and obtain an authentication token.
	=>Add the required widgets in the Blynk app to display health-related data, such as Value Display, Gauge, or Graph.

3.Connect the hardware:

	=>Connect the health monitoring sensors (heart rate sensor, temperature sensor) to the NodeMCU board based on their specific wiring requirements.

4.Use the following code as an example to implement the health monitoring system using NodeMCU and Blynk server:
